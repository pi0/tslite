Smaller Typescript Redistribution

> **Note**
> This is a proof-of-concept work!

## Why?

Typescript size has grown over time and is unreasonably big today ([![install size](https://packagephobia.com/badge?p=typescript)](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=typescript)) to be installed as a dependency in projects.

However this issue had been under the radar of the typescript team for a long time ([microsoft/TypeScript#27891](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27891)) and constant attempts to reduce the install size by @jakebailey and rest of their team ðŸ’™, there are certain decisions typescript cannot do to reduce size further as there is a vast majority of tools and ecosystem that is depending on this package while for user-facing public API, we can make more improvements. The aim of this package is not to step on the toes of typescript core improvements but to provide an alternative redistribution of it that is tailored for end-users needing typescript as a peer dependency.

## How?

Check [`build.ts`](./build.ts) for build steps.

### Minified

Typescript cannot be officially distributed minified because of [preserving stack traces](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27891#issuecomment-1307654814) and [allowing the package to be patched](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27891#issuecomment-1307430212).

However, for normal daily use of typescript, it does not matter unless there is a bug with typescript itself which in this case, we can temporarily switch off tslite.

Minifying big JS files has a huge impact on the install size. tslite only minifies non `lib.` files over 250KB using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

### Removed Locales

Typescript package ships with `~3.8M` of localized translation files for error messages which are usually not used. TSLite removed them.

### Typescript Nightly

@jakebailey recently worked on [microsoft/TypeScript#55273](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/55273) to merge `tsserverlibrary.js` and `typescript.js` and removing a huge amount of duplicate codes.

This change will be available as of [early 5.3](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27891#issuecomment-1676580727). I wasn't patient enough and made this redist based on this improvement to see the difference. (It reduced minified lib size from `~17MB` to `~14MB`)

### More Ideas?

I am thinking about more possible ideas to make typescript lib even smaller. For instance, we can lazily import compiler bits from the network on demand and cache them in a global user file being shared across projects. Ideas and PRs are more than welcome!!

## Usage

Keep `typescript` as a `devDependency` and use resolutions to alias `tslite`:

### npm

Using npm [overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides):

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "overrides": {
    "typescript": "npm:tslite@latest"
  }
}
```

### yarn

Using yarn [selective dependency resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/):

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "typescript": "npm:tslite@latest"
  }
}
```

### pnpm

Using [pnpm.overrides](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides):

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "typescript": "npm:tslite@latest"
    }
  }
}
```
